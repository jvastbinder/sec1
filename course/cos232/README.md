## Assignments & Quizzes

### Reading
Students will be assigned readings frequently. A tentative sketch of the reading schedule is listed in the *schedule* section. Students will often be quizzed over reading assignments before the same material has been covered in lecture.

Students are strongly encouraged to write notes in their lab notebook while reading. Notebooks may be used for some quizzes. 


### Assignments
Students will be assigned seven projects. Each project will take approximately two weeks to complete. Projects will include programming assignments, program analysis, and security-related application usage.

Many security vulnerabilities and attacks take place at the system level. Therefore, for this course, a working knowledge of C and/or C++ will be helpful (COS 121 is a prerequisite). Multiple assignments will require the use of the C programming language. Additionally, students will be required to analyze code snippets from other programming languages including Java, Python, and PHP.

Many assignments will come in the form of a two-week project. However, additional smaller assignments will also be given periodically.


### Quizzes
Instead of few large exams, this course will have many smaller quizzes. There will be two special quizzes: a midterm quiz and a final quiz. All quiz grades are weighted equally. Though the number of questions in these special quizzes will be increased, they will count the same as other quizzes for the final course grade calculation. The final quiz will be given during the scheduled final exam time

Students should expect to take quizzes regularly. Quizzes will take multiple forms: take-home, open-notes, single-question, etc. Students will be permitted to use notes for some  quizzes. Quizzes will emphasize the most recent reading, assignments, and activities. However, all quizzes are cumulative.

Quizzes may not be made up. At the end of the semester, the student's lowest *three* quiz scores will be dropped from the course grade calculation.



## Grading
### Distribution

|                |  % of grade |
|----------------|-------------|
| Assignments    | 50%         |
| Quizzes        | 50%         |



### Scale

| 93 | 90 | 87 | 83 | 80 | 77 | 73 | 70 | 67 | 63 | 60 | < 60 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|------|
| A  | A- | B+ | B  | B- | C+ | C  | C- | D+ | D  | D- | F    |



## Course Policies
### Attendance 
Attendance is expected. Attendance is recorded indirectly when students participate in in-class activities and take quizzes. If a student is absent for an activity or quiz they will receive no credit. Three of the lowest quiz scores for each student will be dropped at the end of the term.

No distinction is made between types of absences (unexcused or excused). Therefore, students do not need to notify the instructor of absences. Accommodations for excused absences are built into the quiz grading policy and is consistent with the *Excessive Absences* section of the *Academic Policies and Regulations* set forth in the [undergraduate catalog](http://www.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/policies.pdf).

Students may appeal to the instructor for special consideration if they feel that this attendance policy has unfairly impacted their grade due to extenuating circumstances.

### Academic Dishonesty & Plagiarism

Students must understand and adhere to all of Taylor University's *Academic Policies and Regulations*. Students should review, in particular, the policy on academic integrity that includes guidelines regarding plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. These policies can be found in the undergraduate catalog. A digital copy of the catalog is locate at the following web address:

- [http://www.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/policies.pdf](http://www.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/policies.pdf)

In an instructional setting, **plagiarism** occurs when a person presents or turns in work that includes someone else's ideas, language, or other (not common-knowledge ) material without giving appropriate credit to the source. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and may result in failing this course, and may also result in further consequences as stipulated in the [Taylor University Undergraduate Catalog](http://www.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/catalog.pdf).**Academic dishonesty** constitutes a serious violation of academic integrity and scholarship standards at Taylor that can result in substantial penalties, at the sole discretion of the University, including but not limited to, denial of credit in a course as well as dismissal from the University.  In short, a student violates academic integrity when he or she claims credit for any work not his or her own (words, ideas, answers, data, program codes, music, etc.) or when a student misrepresents any academic performance. Please see the [Taylor University Undergraduate Catalog](http://www.taylor.edu/academics/files/undergrad-catalog/current/catalog.pdf) for a complete statement.



### Late Work
Late assignments are not accepted.


### Confidentiality
Students should use the LMS to communicate sensitive information to the professor (such as grades).

Students may be asked to (or choose to) use external information systems such as Slack, GitHub, and/or Google applications for this course. Students should not transmit sensitive information using these external communication services. Taylor University has no control over information shared on these external platforms.

Students should not communicate sensitive information over email. Email is nonsecure. If students wish to communicate sensitive information to the instructor using email, they should use public key cryptography. The instructors PGP public key can be found in public key server pools and at the following web address:
